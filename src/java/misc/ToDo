***Assignment 3 Description***
Only a librarian could add a new item. However, both the librarian and the student workers can view a list of items, search (view status) of an item, and check out an item. 
You will also need to add a check-in feature to the system. When an item is checked in, its status should be changed to available and a new activity is added. 
 
Finally, add features to display a report of the account of a patron using their id. 
 
Continue using the MVC pattern and other suitable patterns.
