***Assignment 3 Description***
Only a librarian could add a new item. However, both the librarian and the student workers can view a list of items, search (view status) of an item, and check out an item. 
You will also need to add a check-in feature to the system. When an item is checked in, its status should be changed to available and a new activity is added. 
 
Finally, add features to display a report of the account of a patron using their id. 
 
Continue using the MVC pattern and other suitable patterns.

***Assignment 4 Description****
    In this final iteration, you will add features to enable the librarian and the workers to renew checked out items. You will also enable the system to charge late fees. When an item is overdue, the system should charge a set fee. The library changes the fee structure from time to time and there should be a mechanism for the librarian to set the fee amount and the check out period. In addition, the librarian should be able to indicate whether an item can be renewed or not.
